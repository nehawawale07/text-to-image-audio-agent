# Multimodal AI Agent – Proof of Concept (PoC)

This repository contains a **Proof of Concept (PoC) for a Multimodal AI Agent** built using Python and Jupyter/Colab. The project demonstrates how different AI models can work together to handle **text, audio, and image data** in a unified workflow.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase how multiple modalities (language, audio, and visuals) can be integrated to build intelligent agents. For example:

* Generate audio from text prompts.
* Process and manipulate images using diffusion models.
* Build workflows using modular graph-based execution.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

This project uses several modern AI and multimedia libraries:

1. **PyTorch (`torch`)**

   * Core deep learning framework used for running models.
   * Provides GPU acceleration for training/inference.

2. **Diffusers (`diffusers`)**

   * Hugging Face’s library for diffusion-based generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
   * Used here for image generation/manipulation.

3. **MoviePy (`moviepy`)**

   * Python library for video editing.
   * Enables combining images and audio into video outputs.

4. **LangGraph (`langgraph`)**

   * Workflow orchestration library for chaining multiple AI model calls.
   * Helps structure the agent’s decision-making process.

5. **Bark (`bark`)**

   * Text-to-speech model for generating human-like audio.
   * Converts text responses into natural-sounding voices.

## 🚀 Workflow

Here’s how the multimodal AI agent works step by step:

1. **Input** → The user provides a text/image/audio input depending on the task.
2. **Graph Orchestration (LangGraph)** → The agent determines which models to call.
3. **Text-to-Speech (Bark)** → Converts text outputs into audio (if required).
4. **Image Generation (Diffusers)** → Generates or modifies images based on prompts.
5. **Video Creation (MoviePy)** → Merges generated images and audio into video clips.
6. **Output** → Final multimodal content (text + audio + images/video).
